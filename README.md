It contains all the problems from W3Resource which I use to solve while learning C Programming
when I was new to programming was not able to understand how even the simple loop programs works
I was taking lots of time in analyzing how it's basic syntax works so I started doing one thing,
I sat with pen copy and was solving questions without even knowing or understanding anything 
I was solving each questions on copy and then was analyzing all the stuffs why particular keywords were used 
and by doing this things on regular basis I started building simple logics
